Howdy visitor! ✌️

I'm Kevin Adam, 31 years old living abroad in my campervan. I used to live in Oldenburg, Germany but decided to start a life as a digital nomad. I managed to turn one of my Hobbies into a Profession which resulted in becoming a passionate Full-Stack Software-Developer with a fondness for all kinds of JavaScript (much rather TypeScript) related Projects. Be it mobile, frontend or backend you can count me in.

Aside from work I highly enjoy trips into nature by going Camping, Cycling or Hiking to break out of the digital bubble that consumes our everyday life.
