### Hey there! I'm Kevin Adam,

a 28 years old guy from Oldenburg, Germany. I gladly managed to turn one of my Hobbies into a Profession. This led me ending up as a passionate Full-Stack Software-Developer with a fondness for all kinds of JavaScript related Projects. Be it mobile, frontend or backend as long as it's not PHP I'm in.

Aside from work I highly enjoy trips into nature by going Camping, Mountainbiking or Hiking to break out of the digital bubble that consumes our everyday life.
