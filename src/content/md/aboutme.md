### I'm Kevin Adam, 
a 27 year old Guy from Oldenburg, Germany who managed to turn one of his Hobbies into a Profession.
This led me into ending up as a passionate Full-Stack Software-Developer with a fondness for all kinds of JavaScript related Projects. Be it mobile, frontend or backend as long as it's not PHP I'm in.

Aside from work I highly enjoy trips into nature by going Camping or Hiking to keep some balance from our mostly digital world.
