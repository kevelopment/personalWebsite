Howdy visitor! ✌️

\
I'm Kevin Adam, 31 years old living abroad in my campervan. I used to live in Oldenburg, Germany but decided to start a life as a digital nomad. I managed to turn one of my hobbies into a profession which resulted in becoming a passionate Full-Stack Software-Developer with a fondness for all kinds of web based projects. Be it mobile, frontend or backend you can count me in.

Aside from work I highly enjoy trips into nature by going camping, cycling or hiking to break out of the digital bubble that consumes our everyday life.
