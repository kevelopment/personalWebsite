### I'm Kevin Adam 
a 27 year old Guy from Oldenburg, Germany who managed to turn one of his Hobbies into a Profession.
This led me being a passionate Full-Stack Software-Developer with a fondness for all kinds of JavaScript Projects be it mobile, frontend or backend.

Aside from work I highly enjoy trips into nature by going Camping or Hiking to keep some balance from our mostly digital world.
