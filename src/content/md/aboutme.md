Howdy visitor! ✌️

I'm Kevin Adam, 30 years old and live in Oldenburg, Germany. I managed to turn one of my Hobbies into a Profession. This brought me into being a passionate Full-Stack Software-Developer with a fondness for all kinds of JavaScript related Projects. Be it mobile, frontend or backend as long as it's not PHP I'm in.

Aside from work I highly enjoy trips into nature by going Camping, Cycling or Hiking to break out of the digital bubble that consumes our everyday life.
